  <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">About Dr. Shin</h2>
  <p class="mb-4">
    Dr. <strong>Jae Hyun Shin</strong> is a board-certified infectious diseases physician with extensive clinical experience and a nationally recognized research portfolio focused on infections in older adults. He earned his medical degree from <em>Seoul National University College of Medicine</em>, completed an Internal Medicine residency at <em>Rochester General Hospital</em>, and pursued fellowship training in Infectious Diseases at the <em>University of Virginia Medical Center</em>, where he also completed a postdoctoral research fellowship through the NIH-funded UVA T32 program.
  </p>

  <p class="mb-4">
    His potential as a leader in aging research was recognized early: he was named a <strong>Butler-Williams Scholar</strong> by the <em>National Institute on Aging (NIA)</em> in 2018 and awarded a highly competitive <strong>NIH K08 Career Development Award</strong> in 2019 to investigate age-related susceptibility to <em>Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI)</em>.
  </p>

  <p class="mb-4">
    Dr. Shin’s research explores how aging and microbiome changes impair host immunity to infection. At UVA, he developed aged mouse models to study CDI and evaluated microbiota-based therapies—such as fecal microbiota transplantation—for restoring immune competence in older adults. His work has been published in high-impact journals, and he is a contributing author to the upcoming edition of <strong><em>Mandell, Bennett, and Dolin’s Principles and Practice of Infectious Diseases</em></strong>, writing a chapter on <em>diarrheal diseases</em>.
  </p>

  <p class="mb-4">
    Currently, Dr. Shin practices in <em>Southern California</em> with <em>Hoag Physician Partners</em> and <em>Southern California ID Associates</em>, where he treats a wide range of infectious diseases including multidrug-resistant infections, healthcare-associated infections, and infections in immunocompromised patients. He brings nearly two decades of academic and clinical expertise to his current practice.
  </p>

  <p class="mb-4">
    At the heart of Dr. Shin’s approach is a deeply <strong>patient-centered philosophy</strong>. He is committed to listening carefully to each patient’s story, understanding the full context of their health, and guiding them through complex diagnostic and treatment decisions. His goal is not only to resolve infections, but to empower patients with clarity, compassion, and expert care tailored to their unique needs.
