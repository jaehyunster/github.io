    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 text-blue-700">About Dr. Jae Hyun Shin</h2>

    <p class="mb-5">
      Dr. <strong>Jae Hyun Shin, MD</strong> is a board-certified infectious diseases physician with deep clinical expertise and a nationally recognized background in aging-related infectious disease research. He earned his medical degree from <em>Seoul National University College of Medicine</em>, completed an Internal Medicine residency at <em>Rochester General Hospital</em>, and trained in Infectious Diseases at the <em>University of Virginia Medical Center</em>, where he also completed a postdoctoral research fellowship through the NIH-funded UVA T32 program.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-5">
      During his time at the University of Virginia, in addition to his research, Dr. Shin cared for patients at a specialized <strong>Complicated <em>C. difficile</em> Infection Clinic</strong>. Under the mentorship of <strong>Dr. Cirle Warren</strong>, an internationally recognized expert in <em>C. difficile</em> and infectious diseases, he managed cases of recurrent and severe <em>C. difficile</em> infections referred from across the state and surrounding regions. He collaborated closely with gastroenterologists to deliver comprehensive, multidisciplinary care.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-5">
      His scholarly achievements were recognized by the <em>National Institute on Aging (NIA)</em>, which named him a <strong>Butler-Williams Scholar</strong> in 2018 and awarded him a prestigious <strong>NIH K08 Career Development Award</strong> in 2019 to support his investigations into how age-related changes in the gut microbiome affect immune responses to <em>Clostridioides difficile</em> (<em>C. difficile</em>) infection. His research has been published widely and will be featured in the upcoming <strong>10th edition (2025)</strong> of <strong><em>Mandell, Douglas, and Bennett’s Principles and Practice of Infectious Diseases</em></strong>, where he is contributing a chapter on <em>diarrheal diseases</em>.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-5">
      After years of working at the intersection of science and medicine, Dr. Shin has chosen to <strong>dedicate his knowledge and experience fully to clinical care</strong>. Motivated by his passion for patient interaction and the desire to bring research-driven insight to real-world medicine, he now focuses entirely on helping individuals navigate complex infectious conditions.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-5">
      He currently practices in <em>Southern California</em> with <em>Hoag Physician Partners</em> and <em>Southern California ID Associates</em>, where he cares for patients with a wide range of infectious diseases including multidrug-resistant infections, healthcare-associated infections, and infections in immunocompromised individuals.
    </p>

    <p>
      At the core of Dr. Shin’s approach is a deeply <strong>patient-centered philosophy</strong>. He believes effective care begins with listening—understanding each patient’s story, context, and concerns—and providing thoughtful, individualized guidance through complex diagnostic and treatment decisions. His goal is to not only resolve infections, but to help patients regain clarity, confidence, and control in their health journey.
